# Fox Pet Mod

Hi! I'm Hyrlost. I just want to let you know what the mod is. Before, I created a mod (https://github.com/Hyrlost/FoxPetMod) where I create a new fox entity with the wolf behavior, like to attack with us, be our partner of our travels, etc. This is the exactly same mod but with a very big change. With this mod, the Minecraft Fox was modified with the wolf behavior, so now there is only one Fox entity, in my past mod, there were two different foxes.

Here is a gif where you can see the mod working: https://giphy.com/gifs/vtckOaGOLC1fJpeJx7
